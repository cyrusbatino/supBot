What is it?
*************************

I plan to make a Supreme bot, used to automatically add items to cart and automatically purchase those items.

The Latest Version

v1.0 January 2, 2016

Development
*************************

Here is a list of things that I will do:
1) Research bots written in Python
1a) Understand and play with Nick's bot 
2) Research the infrastructure of the Supreme online shopping source code
3) Figure out what data is needed. So far:
    * How to recognize item (via text or image)
    * How to add item to cart
    * How to checkout
    * How to automatically fill out shipping and billing info
    * How to complete purchase
4) Figure out what the best (super fast and efficient)  search function is needed for this
5) Begin implementation
6) Test with mock site
7) Debug
8) Test on actual site
9) ????
10) Profit

Things to Consider
*************************

Does the Supreme site require a captcha or some sort of human interaction?
Is this as fast and as efficient as it could be?
Will this work on other sites? (e.g. Nike, Adidas)
